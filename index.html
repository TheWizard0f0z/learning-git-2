            <h1>Who's Who</h1>
            <p><span>by Wystan Hugh Auden</span></p>
            <p>A shilling life will give you all the facts:
                <br>How Father beat him, how he ran away,
                <br>What were the struggles of his youth, what acts
                <br>Made him the greatest figure of his day;
                <br>Of how he fought, fished, hunted, worked all night,
                <br>Though giddy, climbed new mountains; named a sea;
                <br>Some of the last researchers even write
                <br>Love made him weep his pints like you and me.
            </p>   
            <p>With all his honours on, he sighed for one
                <br>Who, say astonished critics, lived at home;
                <br>Did little jobs about the house with skill
                <br>And nothing else; could whistle; would sit still
                <br>Or potter round the garden; answered some
                <br>Of his long marvellous letters but kept none.
